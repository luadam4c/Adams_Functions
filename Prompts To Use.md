Can you add code to virt_plot_phase_response.m to also:

1) Calculate and plot the mean or median change in phase in non-overlapping bins of pi/4 radians on the x-axis and check whether its significantly different from zero in each bin.
2) Plot the distribution of x-values and test whether it is significantly different from a uniform distribution

Please use create_subplots.m, test_difference.m and test_normality.m attached if possible
